# Task ledger — fluid-cfd-oracle

**Append only.** Entries are never edited, deleted or reordered. A correction is a new entry that
names the one it corrects. Newest at the bottom, so the file reads chronologically.

An entry is written after **any** code mutation or planning decision in this domain. Its purpose
is to answer one question for the next session: *why does this look the way it does?* A change
without a ledger entry leaves that question unanswerable, which is the audit failure that
*principle 1, trust is a ceiling inherited from provenance*, warns about — an overwritten or
absent history cannot say why anything is trusted.

## Entry format

### <YYYY-MM-DD> — <short title>

- **Status:** `COMPLETED` | `WITHDRAWN` | `SUPERSEDED` (names its replacement)
- **Files:** what changed
- **Signatures:** functions or schemas added or changed
- **Decision:** what was chosen, what was rejected, and why
- **Evidence:** the observed result — test counts, gate output, reproduced values
- **Inherited:** any hazard this leaves open for the next session

`COMPLETED` requires observed evidence and a timestamp. A completion claim without evidence is
*principle 3, never report success over unperformed work*, in document form.

## Entries

*(none yet — this domain has had no code mutation. The skill definition itself is recorded in
`artifacts/00_Governance/2026-09-15_PLAN_ehd_modeling_suite.md` Task 3, not here, because
authoring a skill is not work in its domain.)*
